    <article class="review">
      <p class="review-text">"In the mountainous region of Japan, they came up with this thing called “manga,” which is pretty similar to “comics,” except it’s backwards and it’s black and white. Ever since then, people have become obsessed with manga, and they look forward to reading it every week.

      Imagine my surprise when I found out about something called “Changa” and thought to myself - what could that possibly be? Turns out, it’s what happens when 6 friends (aka “Chicas”) get together and create manga. It’s not Chinese at all.

      Still following?

      So far, Chica Mob Quarterly is shaping up to be not only the greatest Changa ever, but probably the latest craze. It’s about 6 friends and I highly suggest reading it. Whether you enjoy incredible colors, nail biting suspense, or subtle nods to the cultures of places like Japan, and other places such as the beach, this is the Changa for you. Did I mention it features friendship heavily?

      Chica Mob Quarterly changed my life and now I’m obsessed with it. The characters feel so alive that they’re practically jumping off the page, such as the character whose power is chess - cleverly depicted with a chess piece on her head - or the character who can fly. The character “Kathy” is an interesting twist on the “psychic” archetype, because she has psychic powers. They also have the power of lawyer, turning into a pony, as well as “logic and reasoning,” which I had to look up but it basically means thinking. Basically, there are a ton of incredible characters, and the fact that they are all friends makes me excited to find out what will happen every day. Spoiler alert - there’s also an evil horse, which is amazing."</p>
